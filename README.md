Banking websites are designed with security and privacy as top priorities to safeguard sensitive financial information of customers. The website offers a range of services such as checking account balances, transferring funds, paying bills, and viewing transaction history, as well as providing information about the bank's products and services and access to customer support. The website has a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily find what they need and navigate the site. The landing page serves as the main entry point and features the bank's branding elements, such as logo and slogan, along with promotions and quick links to popular services and a login area for existing customers.
